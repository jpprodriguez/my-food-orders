# My Food Orders

## Summary 
My Food Orders is a React/Firebase app made for handling food orders in a company/group/whatever that has a fixed menu for lunch. I wanted to build a base app with the minimun things required to have a functional food order app. There are many things that could be added/refactored, depending on the use you want to give to it

## Use cases
This application is ideal for organizing food orders inside a company that includes lunch for its employees and always order to the same restaurant.

## Profiles
My Food Orders has three different profiles
- Admin: Creates/edits menus, sets current menu, monitors users orders and manage user accounts
- Provider (The restaurant): Has access to users orders 
- Customer: The one who actually orders food
